# Data Visualization and Managerial Insights

## 1. Total Bookings by Room Type and Neighborhood Group
I have used a stacked bar chart for showing the total number of bookings for each room type in each neighborhood group. This compares the booking volumes between different neighborhoods and types of accommodations.

## 2. Average Reviews per Month by Room Type and Neighborhood Group
I have used a heatmap to showcase the average number of reviews per month. In this heatmap, a darker shade of color means more reviews.

## 3. Average Price in the Neighborhoods by Room Type
I have used a map to show all the listings from the dataset and how the listings are spread to understand the spatial distribution.

## 4. Maximum Number of Nights Stayed in Each Room Type
I have used a grouped bar chart displaying the maximum number of nights guests stayed, divided by room type and neighborhood group.

## 5. Number of Reviews by Year
I have used a line graph to show the total number of reviews for each year.

## 6. Sum of Reviews by Room Type
I have used a horizontal bar chart to represent the total number of reviews received for each room type.

## 7. Average Price in Each Neighborhood - Neighborhood Group
I have used a bar chart to rank neighborhoods by average price within all neighborhood groups.

## 8. Host_Listing
It is a summary/key indicator showing the total number of listings by the host.

### Managerial Implications/Steps to be Taken
1. **Dynamic Pricing Models:** We can think of implementing dynamic pricing strategies to leverage peak seasons like summers and remain competitive during normal/off times.

2. **Quality Investment:** Focus on enhancing the guest hospitality experience, as reviews have a strong impact on repeat bookings and overall success.

3. **Market Development:** Encourage property listings in less explored areas such as the Bronx and Staten Island where listings are low, but pricing is also on the lower side to attract a wide range of guests looking for diverse experiences.

4. **Diversified Offerings:** Create tailored promotions for both private accommodations to tap into market needs.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, our thorough exploration of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset has provided insights into market trends, pricing patterns, and customer preferences.

Identifying growth and improvement areas will be mutually beneficial for both hosts and Airbnb. Improving the distribution of listings, implementing pricing tactics, and offering better customer satisfaction would enable the value chain players to easily align with the demand needs of the market, thereby enhancing their competitive advantage.
